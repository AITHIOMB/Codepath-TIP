Problem 8: Pooh's To Do's
Write a function print_todo_list() that accepts a list of strings named tasks. The function should then number and print each task on a new line using the format:

Pooh's To Dos:
1. Task 1
2. Task 2
...

def print_todo_list(task):
	pass
Example Usage

task = ["Count all the bees in the hive", "Chase all the clouds from the sky", "Think", "Stoutness Exercises"]
print_todo_list(task)

task = []
print_todo_list(task)
Example Output:

Pooh's To Dos:
1. Count all the bees in the hive
2. Chase all the clouds from the sky
3. Think
4. Stoutness Exercises

Pooh's To Dos:
âœ¨ AI Hint: range()

Problem 9: Pairs
Rabbit is very particular about his belongings and wants to own an even number of each thing he owns. Write a function can_pair() that accepts a list of integers item_quantities. Return True if each number in item_quantities is even. Return False otherwise.

def can_pair(item_quantities):
	pass
Example Usage

item_quantities = [2, 4, 6, 8]
can_pair(item_quantities)

item_quantities = [1, 2, 3, 4]
can_pair(item_quantities)

item_quantities = []
can_pair(item_quantities)
Example Output:

True
False
True

Problem 10: Split Haycorns
Piglet's has collected a big pile of his favorite food, haycorns, and wants to split them evenly amongst his friends. Write a function split_haycorns() to help Piglet determine the number of ways he can split his haycorns into even groups. split_haycorns() accepts a positive integer quantity as a parameter and returns a list of all divisors of quantity.

def split_haycorns(quantity):
	pass
Example Usage

quantity = 6
split_haycorns(quantity)

quantity = 1
split_haycorns(quantity)
Example Output:

[1, 2, 3, 6]
[1]


Problem 11: T-I-Double Guh-ER
Signs in the Hundred Acre Wood have been losing letters as Tigger bounces around stealing any letters he needs to spell out his name. Write a function tiggerfy() that accepts a string s, and returns a new string with the letters t, i, g, e, and r from it.

def tiggerfy(s):
	pass
Example Usage

s = "suspicerous"
tiggerfy(s)

s = "Trigger"
tiggerfy(s)

s = "Hunny"
tiggerfy(s)
Example Output:

"suspcous"
""
"Hunny"

Problem 12: Thistle Hunt
Pooh, Piglet, and Roo are looking for thistles to gift their friend Eeyore. Write a function locate_thistles() that takes in a list of strings items and returns a list of the indices of any elements with value "thistle". The indices in the resulting list should be ordered from least to greatest.

def locate_thistles(items):
	pass
Example Usage

items = ["thistle", "stick", "carrot", "thistle", "eeyore's tail"]
locate_thistles(items)

items = ["book", "bouncy ball", "leaf", "red balloon"]
locate_thistles(items)
Example Output:

[0, 3]
[]
